Basic C quine (self replicating program) adapted from [here](http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/quine.html).

Files:
- `code.c` contains the actual logic of the program
- `code_to_data.py` generates the data part of the program and writes everything to a file `main.c` which is self replicating
- `main.c` the quine itself (generated by running `code_to_data.py`)

To see the quine in action:
```
$ gcc main.c
$ ./a.out > output.txt
$ diff main.c output.txt
```

The diff should return empty handed, meaning `main.c` successfully replicated itself.
